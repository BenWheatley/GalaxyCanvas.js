# GalaxyCanvas.js
Proof of concept; Procedural galaxy, rendering 3D using only 2D graphics Canvas element. Animated, continuously spins in one axis and wobbles in another.

Hacked together while I was waiting for the plane to take off from Keflavik International Airport. No WiFi, so had to figure everything out from first principles, memory of ten year old maths lessons, and existing sample code (hence using Canvas elements and 2D graphics libraries when 3D libraries would be clearly more sensible).
